                <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The artifact selected for this enhancement is the Inventory Manager application, originally
                    developed
                    for CS-360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming). This Android application provides
                    basic inventory management functionality, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete inventory
                    items through a mobile interface. The original implementation used a traditional activity-based
                    architecture with direct database interactions within the UI layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Original Features:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul id=list1>
                    <li>User authentication (login/register)</li>
                    <li>CRUD operations for inventory items</li>
                    <li>SQLite database integration</li>
                    <li>Basic UI with RecyclerView for item display</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="narrative-section">
                <h2>Justification for Inclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    I selected this artifact for Enhancement One because it presented an excellent opportunity to
                    demonstrate my understanding of software design patterns and architectural best practices. The
                    original implementation, while functional, suffered from several design issues common in early
                    Android development:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tight coupling</strong> between UI components and business logic</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficulty in testing</strong> due to dependencies on Android framework components</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor separation of concerns</strong> making maintenance and extension challenging</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of lifecycle awareness</strong> leading to potential memory leaks</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By refactoring this application to implement the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern,
                    I was able to showcase my ability to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply industry-standard architectural patterns to improve code quality</li>
                    <li>Implement Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData, Repository pattern)</li>
                    <li>Create modular, maintainable, and testable code</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate understanding of software engineering principles like separation of concerns and
                        dependency inversion</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="narrative-section">
                <h2>Specific Components Showcasing Skills</h2>

                <h3>1. ViewModel Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    I created dedicated ViewModel classes for each major feature (InventoryViewModel, LoginViewModel),
                    which manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. This demonstrates my understanding of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Android lifecycle management</li>
                    <li>Data survival across configuration changes</li>
                    <li>Proper state management in mobile applications</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. LiveData Integration</h3>
                <p>
                    I implemented LiveData observers to enable reactive UI updates, ensuring the interface automatically
                    reflects changes in the underlying data. This showcases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding of reactive programming principles</li>
                    <li>Ability to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of observer pattern implementation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Repository Pattern</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a repository layer to abstract data sources and provide a clean API for data operations.
                    This demonstrates:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding of clean architecture principles</li>
                    <li>Ability to create maintainable abstractions</li>
                    <li>Preparation for future scalability (easy to add remote data sources)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Dependency Injection Principles</h3>
                <p>
                    While not using a full DI framework, I structured the code to enable easy dependency injection,
                    improving testability and modularity.

                <h2>Enhancement Process and Learning</h2>

                <h3>Planning and Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Before beginning the refactoring process, I created a comprehensive architecture diagram to
                    visualize
                    the new structure and identify the components needed. This planning phase reinforced the importance
                    of thinking through design decisions before implementation—a critical skill in professional software
                    development.
                </p>

                <h3>Implementation Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    The refactoring process presented several challenges that deepened my understanding:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data flow redesign:</strong> I had to completely rethink how data flows through the
                        application, moving from direct database calls to a layered architecture with proper
                        abstractions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lifecycle management:</strong> Understanding how ViewModels survive configuration
                        changes
                        and properly scope their lifecycle taught me important lessons about Android development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Threading considerations:</strong> Implementing database operations on background
                        threads
                        while updating UI on the main thread required careful attention to threading models.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    This enhancement process taught me several valuable lessons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Architectural patterns aren't just theory:</strong> Implementing MVVM provided tangible
                        benefits in code organization and testability, demonstrating why these patterns are industry
                        standards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Refactoring requires discipline:</strong> I learned to make incremental changes, test
                        frequently, and maintain backwards compatibility during the transition period.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Documentation is crucial:</strong> Creating clear code comments and architectural
                        documentation made the refactoring process smoother and will benefit future maintainers.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="narrative-section">
