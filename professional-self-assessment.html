            <div class="assessment-section">
                <h2>Collaborating in Team Environments</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most valuable skills I have developed is the ability to work effectively in collaborative
                    environments. In CS-250 (Software Development Lifecycle), I learned to apply Agile and Scrum
                    methodologies, understanding how software teams coordinate to deliver iterative value to
                    stakeholders. I participated in sprint planning exercises, learned to write effective user stories,
                    and understood the importance of retrospectives in continuous improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experience in CS-465 (Full Stack Development) further demonstrated collaborative principles as I
                    built the Travlr Getaways application using the MEAN stack. This project required me to think about
                    how frontend and backend developers would work together, considering API design that would
                    facilitate seamless integration between Angular components and Express.js endpoints. I documented my
                    code thoroughly with comments and README files, understanding that in professional environments,
                    code must be readable and maintainable by other team members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code review I conducted for this capstone exemplifies industry-standard collaborative practices.
                    By critically analyzing my own code and explaining my enhancement plans, I demonstrated the ability
                    to engage in the peer review process—a cornerstone of professional software development. I
                    approached the code review with the mindset that others would need to understand my reasoning,
                    implement my changes, or build upon my work, which reflects the reality of team-based development
                    environments.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="assessment-section">
                <h2>Communicating with Stakeholders</h2>
                <p>
                    Effective communication with diverse audiences has been a consistent focus throughout my program. In
                    IT-212 (Networking), I learned to translate complex technical concepts into language accessible to
                    non-technical stakeholders. When designing network infrastructure for business locations, I created
                    documentation that IT professionals could implement while also preparing executive summaries that
                    business leaders could use for decision-making.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work in CS-465 required me to communicate technical decisions through comprehensive
                    documentation, explaining architectural choices such as the single-page application (SPA) design
                    using Angular and the RESTful API structure. I learned to justify technology selections based on
                    business requirements, demonstrating how JWT authentication and MongoDB would meet the application's
                    needs for security and scalability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The narratives accompanying each enhancement in this ePortfolio further showcase my ability to
                    communicate complex technical achievements to various audiences. I have written these narratives to
                    be accessible to hiring managers who may not have deep technical expertise, while still providing
                    sufficient detail for technical reviewers to understand the sophistication of my work. This balance
                    is critical in professional settings where I must advocate for technical decisions to stakeholders
                    with varying levels of technical knowledge.
                </p>

            <div class="assessment-section">
                <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
                <p>
                    My understanding of data structures and algorithms has evolved significantly throughout the program,
                    moving from theoretical knowledge to practical application. In CS-260 (Data Structures and
                    Algorithms), I gained foundational knowledge of sorting algorithms, search techniques, and
                    complexity analysis. I learned to evaluate algorithmic efficiency using Big O notation and to select
                    appropriate data structures based on use-case requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithms and data structures enhancement in my capstone project demonstrates this growth in
                    practical terms. I implemented efficient search functionality for the Inventory Manager application,
                    incorporating binary search algorithms for sorted data and optimizing database queries to reduce
                    time complexity. I also integrated priority queue functionality using heap data structures,
                    demonstrating my ability to select and implement advanced data structures that provide real
                    performance benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work in MAT-350 (Applied Linear Algebra) strengthened my algorithmic thinking by exposing me to
                    matrix operations, eigenvalue computations, and singular value decomposition (SVD) using MATLAB.
                    These mathematical algorithms reinforced my understanding of computational complexity and the
                    importance of optimizing iterative processes—skills directly applicable to software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I have applied algorithmic thinking to solve real-world problems beyond coursework.
                    When troubleshooting technical issues, I approach problems systematically: identifying the root
                    cause, considering multiple solutions, evaluating trade-offs, and implementing the most efficient
                    approach. This problem-solving methodology is evident throughout my academic work and will be
                    invaluable in professional software development roles.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="assessment-section">
                <h2>Software Engineering and Databases</h2>
                <p>
                    My proficiency in software engineering principles and database management has been developed through
                    multiple courses and practical applications. In CS-340 (Advanced Programming Concepts), I worked
                    extensively with MongoDB and Python, learning to design NoSQL database schemas and implement CRUD
                    operations. In DAD-220 (Introduction to SQL), I mastered relational database design, normalization,
                    and complex query construction using MySQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Travlr Getaways project in CS-465 integrated these skills by implementing a full-stack
                    application with MongoDB as the database layer. I designed the database schema to efficiently store
                    trip information, user data, and booking records. I implemented data validation on both the client
                    and server sides, ensuring data integrity throughout the application. The use of Mongoose schemas
                    provided an additional layer of validation and structure to the database design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the software engineering enhancement in this capstone, I refactored the Inventory Manager
                    application to implement the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. This enhancement
                    demonstrates my understanding of software design principles, including separation of concerns,
                    modularity, and maintainability. By decoupling the user interface from the business logic, I created
                    a more testable and scalable application architecture—a critical skill for building enterprise-grade
                    software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The database enhancement in this capstone focused on security, implementing SQLite encryption,
                    parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks, and secure password hashing using bcrypt.
                    This work demonstrates my ability to identify security vulnerabilities in database implementations
                    and apply industry-standard solutions to mitigate risks.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="assessment-section">
                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a security mindset has been one of the most critical aspects of my education, and it
                    permeates all of my work in this capstone. In CS-405 (Secure Coding), I learned to identify common
                    vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, and improper authentication mechanisms.
                    I studied the OWASP Top 10 and learned to apply secure coding practices throughout the software
                    development lifecycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The database enhancement in my capstone directly addresses security concerns by implementing
                    multiple layers of defense. I replaced plaintext password storage with bcrypt hashing, ensuring that
                    even if the database were compromised, user credentials would remain protected. I implemented
                    parameterized queries throughout the application, eliminating SQL injection vulnerabilities that
                    existed in the original code. Additionally, I explored SQLite encryption options to protect data at
                    rest, demonstrating defense-in-depth principles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond database security, I applied security thinking to the MVVM architecture enhancement. By
                    properly separating concerns and implementing input validation in the ViewModel layer, I created
                    additional barriers against malicious input. I documented potential security considerations in my
                    code comments, demonstrating the proactive security mindset that is essential in modern software
                    development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My networking coursework in IT-212 also contributed to my security awareness by teaching me about
                    network-level security considerations such as firewall configurations, secure network topology
                    design, and the importance of segmenting sensitive systems. This holistic understanding of
                    security—spanning application code, database management, and network infrastructure—positions me to
                    build secure systems from the ground up.

                    journey of growth, learning, and professional development throughout the Computer Science program.
                    Each enhancement demonstrates specific technical skills while also reflecting the broader
                    competencies I have developed: collaboration, communication, problem-solving, and a commitment to
                    quality and security.

                    I am grateful for the comprehensive education I have received at SNHU, which has provided me with
                    both the theoretical foundation and practical skills necessary to succeed in the software industry.
                    As I transition from student to professional, I carry with me not just technical knowledge but also
                    the values that will guide my career: a commitment to continuous learning, a dedication to producing
                    high-quality work, and a recognition that software development is ultimately about creating value
                    and solving problems for users.

                    This capstone project has challenged me to integrate everything I have learned, to think critically
                    about my own work, and to present myself professionally. I am excited to apply these skills in my
                    career and to continue growing as a software professional in an industry that is constantly evolving
                    and full of opportunities for those who approach it with curiosity, dedication, and a commitment to
                    excellence.
